# Movies-Arena
Its a movie information app built using Vanilla JavaScript and HTML/CSS. The UI is  mainly for the mobile devices. I've used the omdb api for fetching the data of the movies. The movie poster , release year, production,imdb ,etc are displayed in the UI. It has a dark UI which seems pretty cool.
